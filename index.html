                        <p>Anki is a program which makes remembering things easy. Because it's a lot more efficient than traditional study methods, you can either greatly decrease your time spent studying, or greatly increase the amount you learn.</p>
                        <p>Anyone who needs to remember things in their daily life can benefit from Anki. Since it is content-agnostic and supports images, audio, videos and scientific markup (via LaTeX), the possibilities are endless.
                            For example:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Learning a language</li>
                            <li>Studying for medical and law exams</li>
                            <li>Memorizing people's names and faces</li>
                            <li>Brushing up on geography</li>
                            <li>Mastering long poems</li>
                            <li>Even practicing guitar chords!</li>

                        <p>"I've been using Anki for two years now, and I just wanted to thank you personally for contributing to the single most obvious improvement in my quality of life. I'm not being hyperbolic: consistent use of Anki has opened more doors for me intellectually than I could have imagined two years ago. And being a poor student, I'll be forever grateful that you've provided this software open-source and free of charge."</p>
